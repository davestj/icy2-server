# ICY2-SERVER CHANGELOG

**Project:** mcaster1.com DNAS ICY2-SERVER  
**Author:** davestj@gmail.com (David St. John)  
**Repository:** /var/www/mcaster1.com/DNAS/icy2-server

## [1.1.2] - 2025-07-21

### üîß CRITICAL FIXES
- **FIXED**: server.cpp line 112 - Resolved shared_ptr to raw pointer conversion error
- **FIXED**: server.cpp line 1067 - Corrected method name from `reload_config()` to `reload_if_modified()`
- **ENHANCED**: Updated all server_config references to use proper shared_ptr dereferencing
- **IMPROVED**: Added comprehensive error handling in configuration loading process

### üìù Technical Details
I resolved compilation errors that were preventing the build from completing successfully. The main issues were related to improper handling of shared_ptr types and incorrect method naming in the ConfigParser class.

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `initialize()` method to properly handle shared_ptr returned by `get_config()`
- Updated `reload_configuration()` method to use correct ConfigParser method name
- Enhanced error checking and validation throughout the server initialization process
- Maintained thread-safe configuration access patterns

### üöÄ Git Commit Commands
```bash
git add src/server.cpp
git commit -m "fix: resolve compilation errors in server.cpp - shared_ptr handling and method names"
git add CHANGELOG.md CARRY_OVER.md
git commit -m "docs: update changelog and carryover for compilation fixes"
```

### üîÑ Next Development Features
- Implement WebSocket support for real-time stream monitoring
- Add advanced SSL certificate management and auto-renewal
- Enhance connection pooling and load balancing capabilities
- Integrate comprehensive logging and monitoring dashboard
- Add clustering support for high-availability deployments
