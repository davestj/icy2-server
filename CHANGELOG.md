## [v1.1.2] - 2025-07-21 - Critical Compilation Resolution

### ðŸ”§ Build System Fixes

**Critical Compilation Errors Resolved**
This release addresses critical compilation errors that were preventing successful build completion of the ICY2-SERVER. The primary issues were related to missing method implementations in the ICYHandler class that were declared in the header file but not implemented in the corresponding source file.

**Method Implementations Added:**
- ICYHandler::configure() - Added complete handler initialization method supporting both legacy ICY 1.x and modern ICY 2.0+ protocol configuration
- ICYHandler::add_mount_point() - Implemented mount point creation method serving as a compatibility alias for server integration requirements  
- ICYHandler::handle_source_connection() - Added comprehensive source connection management method for broadcaster authentication and registration
- ICYHandler::handle_listener_connection() - Implemented client connection processing method with support for metadata preference detection and listener registration

**Supporting Utility Methods:**
- extract_mount_path_from_uri() - Added URI processing utility for extracting mount point paths from connection requests
- validate_connection_headers() - Implemented connection header validation method providing basic security and format checking

### ðŸŽ¯ Interface Compliance

**Header-Implementation Alignment**
The added methods ensure complete interface compliance between the ICYHandler header declarations and the corresponding implementation file. This alignment resolves compilation errors that occurred when server.cpp attempted to invoke methods that were declared but not implemented.

**Thread Safety Enhancements**
All added methods maintain the established thread safety patterns using appropriate mutex locks for shared resource access. The implementations follow the existing concurrency model to ensure safe operation in the multi-threaded server environment.

### Git Commit Reference
```
